//With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
//When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

//With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
// JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
// JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
// JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
// JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
// JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
// JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
// JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

// The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

// The HTML elements as objects
// The properties of all HTML elements
// The methods to access all HTML elements
// The events for all HTML elements
//The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
